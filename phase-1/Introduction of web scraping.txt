Web Scraping : 

      
      Web scraping means automatically collecting data from websites using code instead of copying and 
      pasting information 
              
             Ex:  Flipkart, Amazon ( Price Comparison )


Uses of Web Scraping :
         
         1. Financial Data Collection
         2. Social Media
         3.Price comparison tools
         4.Data Analytics


Tools :
 I used the these tools


        1. Requests – it is a Python library used to send HTTP/HTTPS requests to websites.

        2. BeautifulSoup – We use BeautifulSoup to easily extract data from HTML webpages.

        3. Scrapy – Scrapy is used when you want to scrape many pages fast and efficiently.

        4. Selenium – forSelenium is a browser automation tool used to control a real web browser using code.



Web Scraping Works

         You send a request to a website

         The website sends back HTML code

         Your program extracts needed data

         You save it (CSV, Excel, database)
