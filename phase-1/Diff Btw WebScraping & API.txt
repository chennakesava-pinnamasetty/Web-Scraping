Web Scraping 

Web scraping is an automated technique used to extract data from websites. Instead of manually copying and pasting information 
Web scraping means automatically collecting data from websites using code instead of copy-paste. 

How Web Scraping Works 
1. You send a request to a website 

2. The website sends back HTML code 

3. Your program extracts needed data 

4. You save it (CSV, Excel, database) 

          Flow Chat : Website → HTML → Scraper → Clean Data 



Common Tools (Beginner-Friendly) 

Python Libraries 

• Requests – get website content 
• BeautifulSoup – read HTML & extract data 
• Scrapy – fast & powerful for big projects 
• Selenium – for dynamic websites (JS-based) 




API : Application Programming Interface. 

An API is a bridge that allows two applications to talk to each other. 
An API is a bridge that allows two applications to communicate with each other. 
In web scraping, an API is a direct way to get data from a website’s server without extracting it from HTML pages. 


Simple Explanation 

There are two ways to get data from a website: 
1. Scraping HTML pages (using BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium) 
2. Using an API (if the website provides one) 

API is the clean and official way to get data. 
Web scraping is used when there is no API. 


Simple Difference (One Line) 
• API → Website gives data officially 
• Web Scraping → You take data from website HTML 


Example : 

Suppose you want movie data. 

Without API (Scraping) 

You: 
• Send request to website 
• Get HTML 
• Parse HTML 
• Extract titles manually 


With API 

You: 
• Send request to API endpoint 
• Get data directly in JSON format 
• No need to parse HTML 
 
 
API Web Scraping 

Official & legal Sometimes risky 
Clean data (JSON/XML) Messy HTML 
Fast & stable Can break 
Permission-based Can be blocked 
 
   Always prefer API if available
