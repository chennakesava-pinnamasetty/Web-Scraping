# Web Scraping Internship

This repository contains my internship work on web scraping using Python.

I used Python to collect data from websites using tools like Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.

The project helped me understand how websites work, how to parse HTML, and how to extract required data from web pages.
